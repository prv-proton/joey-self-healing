          <h2>UniverCcity Program ($59.95)</h2>
          <p>At UniverCcity, we believe that everyone deserves kindness, connection, and compassion. Our
            compassionate companions program is dedicated to supporting elderly individuals and people with disabilities
            by providing meaningful companionship, emotional support, and a sense of community.</p>
          <p>Once you purchase the program, you will receive the program, but a free copy of my book will be shipped to
            you with a logistics fee with Amazon. A $10 value.</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li><span class="check">✓</span><span>You will be donating $10 towards a future in recovery.</span></li>
            <li><span class="check">✓</span><span>$10 towards helping children in the community and memory of Diana,
                Princess of Wales, to honor her humanitarian legacy and support hunger relief.</span></li>
            <li><span class="check">✓</span><span>$10 to Food Banks.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:12px; font-weight: 600; color:var(--primary-strong);">And just to be clear $9.95 will be
